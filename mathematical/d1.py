''' Problem Statement :

After JEE Mains, some students got admission into an engineering college. 
Now there is a class consisting of such n students, and the HOD came to say it is time to select the class monitor. 
But He never gets all of them at one time. So he brought a register, every time he gets someone with less rank than the previous time he cut the name and wrote the name of the student and the rank.
For a given number of ranks he gets each time, you have to predict how many names are cut in the list.

Constraints:
Number of Visiting<=10^9
ranks <=10000

Input Format:
Number of Visiting N in their first line
N space separated ranks the HOD gets each time

Output Format:
Number of ranks cut in the list

Sample Input:
6
4 3 7 2 6 1

Sample Output:
3 '''

n=int(input())
a=list(map(int,input().split()))
m=a[0]
ans=0
for i in range(n):
    if a[i]<m:
        ans+=1
print(ans)
